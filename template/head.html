<!-- Instead of saving data directly into variables in a normal <script>, data is separated into
     above non-executed script blocks. This way, potential Content Security Policy restrictions
     only apply to static script blocks, which can be added as sha256 exceptions.

     As a precaution the script is wrapped in raw block to remind developers that data should
     not be injected directly into it. -->
